When you draw a curve on paper its never perfect. But its easy to get things down. When you draw in an illustration app it's easy to draw things, but hard to make things look good. It takes a skilled designer to make things look good. But what if the illustration app helped users to draw things that great designers has used for ages. Symmetry, elliptical shapes , curves that seem to effortlessly meet to make perfect swan-like curves. What makes some illustrations look so good and others not? Bellow are some examples of what DrawLab will solve with simple interactions:
